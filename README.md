House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project involves predicting the median housing value (MedHouseVal) for different regions based on various features such as median income, house age, average rooms, and other relevant factors. The dataset used for this project contains information about various neighborhoods in California, with features like MedInc, HouseAge, AveRooms, and others that are used to predict housing prices.

The project employs machine learning algorithms to train a model that can accurately predict the median house value (MedHouseVal) for new, unseen data. We use popular libraries like Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy within an Anaconda environment to process, train, and evaluate the model.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: The data is cleaned and preprocessed, including handling missing values and scaling numerical features for better model performance.

Model Training: Multiple machine learning models are trained, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Regressor.

Model Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² Score.

Prediction: The trained model can be used to predict housing prices for new input data.

Technologies Used
Anaconda: A powerful open-source distribution for Python and R, used to create an isolated environment for project dependencies.

Python 3.x: The primary programming language for this project.

Scikit-learn: A machine learning library used for training models and evaluating performance.

Pandas: A Python library for data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: A library for numerical operations.

Matplotlib/Seaborn: Libraries for visualizing data and model results.

Installation Instructions
Install Anaconda: Download and install Anaconda from the official website: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual.

Clone the Repository: If you're using Git, you can clone the project repository to your local machine:

git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>

Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing:

The data is first loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.

Missing values, if any, are handled appropriately.

Numerical features are scaled using StandardScaler to ensure better model performance.

Model Training:

The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

The following models are trained:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Model Evaluation:

After training, the models are evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R² Score

Prediction:

A new data sample can be provided, and the trained model predicts the housing value for that sample.

Data scaling is applied to the new input before prediction.

Visualization:

Graphical representations, including bar charts and line plots, are used to visualize the results, such as the relationship between features and the target variable, and model performance.

Example
Here’s an example of how you can use the trained model to predict a new house price:

# Data for a new region
new_data = {'MedInc': 6.0, 'HouseAge': 35, 'AveRooms': 5.5, 'AveBedrms': 1.2, 'Population': 200, 'AveOccup': 2.5,
           'Latitude': 37.8, 'Longitude': -122.3}
new_df = pd.DataFrame(new_data, index=[0])

# Scale and predict
new_df_scaled = scaler.transform(new_df)
predicted_price = rforest.predict(new_df_scaled)
print("Predicted median housing value:", predicted_price)
Results
The Random Forest model showed the best performance, providing accurate predictions with a high R² score.

The decision tree model performed well but was slightly overfitted.

Linear regression was faster but less accurate compared to the other models.

Error Handling
In case of any errors, such as incorrect input data or missing features, appropriate error handling is implemented in the code. The following exceptions are caught:

ValueError: Raised if there’s an issue during the transformation or prediction (e.g., invalid data type).

KeyError: Raised if the column names in the input data don't match the training data.

Exception: Catches all other unexpected errors.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to predict housing prices based on various features. By training different models and evaluating their performance, you can make informed decisions about which model is the best for your specific dataset. With the trained models, you can predict housing prices for new data samples, which can be applied in real estate analysis or investment decision-making.
