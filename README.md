# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project involves predicting the **median housing value (MedHouseVal)** for different regions in California based on features like:

- Median Income (`MedInc`)
- House Age (`HouseAge`)
- Average Number of Rooms (`AveRooms`)
- Average Bedrooms (`AveBedrms`)
- Population (`Population`)
- Average Occupancy (`AveOccup`)
- Geographic Coordinates (`Latitude`, `Longitude`)

The goal is to use machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model using libraries like **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, and **NumPy** — all within an **Anaconda** environment.

## ✨ Key Features

✅ **Data Preprocessing**  
✔️ Cleaning and transforming the data  
✔️ Handling missing values  
✔️ Scaling features using `StandardScaler`

✅ **Model Training**  
✔️ Trains multiple models:
- Linear Regression  
- Decision Tree Regressor  
- Random Forest Regressor  

✅ **Model Evaluation**  
✔️ Uses the following metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- R² Score

✅ **Prediction**  
✔️ Predicts housing value for new unseen input data  
✔️ Automatically scales input before prediction
